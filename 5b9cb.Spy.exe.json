Adversaries have also abused file application features, such as the Windows search-ms protocol handler, to deliver malicious files to victims through remote file searches invoked by User Execution (typically after interacting with Phishing lures).\nFiles can also be transferred using various Web Services as well as native or otherwise present tools on the victim system. In some cases, adversaries may be able to leverage services that sync between a web-based and an on-premises client, such as Dropbox or OneDrive, to transfer files onto victim systems. For example, by compromising a cloud account and logging into the service's web portal, an adversary may be able to trigger an automatic syncing process that transfers the file onto the victim's machine.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "(Process #1) bpl new po-2000023038.exe downloads file via http from http://hirosavva-cn.com/panel/uploads/Eugkhub.pdf."}]}]}]}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/5b9cbfbb4ecf5f250363a274af2e216baf2707551551886742614e1929e38fae/behaviour_mitre_trees"}}
