Adversaries may use the information from Security Software Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.\nExample commands that can be used to obtain security software information are netsh, reg query with Reg, dir with cmd, and Tasklist, but other indicators of discovery behavior may be more specific to the type of software or security system the adversary is looking for. It is becoming more common to see macOS malware perform checks for LittleSnitch and KnockKnock software.\nAdversaries may also utilize the Cloud API to discover cloud-native security software installed on compute infrastructure, such as the AWS CloudWatch agent, Azure VM Agent, and Google Cloud Monitor agent. These agents  may collect  metrics and logs from the VM, which may be centrally aggregated in a cloud-based monitoring platform.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "May try to detect the virtual machine to hinder analysis (VM artifact strings found in memory)"}, {"severity": "INFO", "description": "AV process strings found (often used to terminate AV products)"}]}, {"id": "T1082", "name": "System Information Discovery", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/", "description": "An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture. Adversaries may use the information from System Information Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.\nTools such as Systeminfo can be used to gather detailed system information. If running with privileged access, a breakdown of system data can be gathered through the systemsetup configuration tool on macOS. As an example, adversaries with user-level access can execute the df -aH command to obtain currently mounted disks and associated freely available space. Adversaries may also leverage a Network Device CLI on network devices to gather detailed system information (e.g. show version). System Information Discovery combined with information gathered from other forms of discovery and reconnaissance can drive payload development and concealment.\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure allow access to instance and virtual machine information via APIs. Successful authenticated API calls can return data such as the operating system platform and status of a particular instance or the model view of a virtual machine.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "Reads software policies"}, {"severity": "INFO", "description": "Queries the volume information (name, serial number etc) of a device"}]}]}, {"id": "TA0011", "name": "Command and Control", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/", "description": "The adversary is trying to communicate with compromised systems to control them.\n\nCommand and Control consists of techniques that adversaries may use to communicate with systems under their control within a victim network.
