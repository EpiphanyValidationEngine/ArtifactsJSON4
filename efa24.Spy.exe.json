System Information Discovery combined with information gathered from other forms of discovery and reconnaissance can drive payload development and concealment.\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure allow access to instance and virtual machine information via APIs. Successful authenticated API calls can return data such as the operating system platform and status of a particular instance or the model view of a virtual machine.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "Reads software policies"}, {"severity": "INFO", "description": "Sample reads itself and does not show any behavior, likely it performs some host environment checks and compares to an embedded key"}]}]}]}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/efa24d6bcd1344223b60047a88d9be6dc8267666c12daad2f1b4e56a9a0ddd7f/behaviour_mitre_trees"}}
