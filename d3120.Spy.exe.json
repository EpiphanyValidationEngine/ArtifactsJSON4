Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts.

Reflective loading involves allocating then executing payloads directly within the memory of the process, vice creating a thread or process backed by a file path on disk (e.g., Shared Modules).\nReflectively loaded payloads may be compiled binaries, anonymous files (only present in RAM), or just snubs of fileless executable code (ex: position-independent shellcode). For example, the Assembly.Load() method executed by PowerShell may be abused to load raw code into the running process.\nReflective code injection is very similar to Process Injection except that the \u201cinjection\u201d loads code into the processes\u2019 own memory instead of that of a separate process. Reflective loading may evade process-based detections since the execution of the arbitrary code may be masked within a legitimate or otherwise benign process. Reflectively loading payloads directly into memory may also avoid creating files or other artifacts on disk, while also enabling malware to keep these payloads encrypted (or otherwise obfuscated) until execution.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "invoke .NET assembly method"}, {"severity": "INFO", "description": "load .NET assembly"}]}]}]}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/d31208b71987d8cdbb8affc975333950516b6aa23951020fbd536fa27e1d1f0b/behaviour_mitre_trees"}}
