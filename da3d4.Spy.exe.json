In some cases, windows that would typically be displayed when an application carries out an operation can be hidden. This may be utilized by system administrators to avoid disrupting user work environments when carrying out administrative tasks. \nAdversaries may abuse these functionalities to hide otherwise visible windows from users so as not to alert the user to adversary activity on the system.\nOn macOS, the configurations for how applications run are listed in property list (plist) files. One of the tags in these files can be apple.awt.UIElement, which allows for Java applications to prevent the application's icon from appearing in the Dock. A common use for this is when applications run in the system tray, but don't also want to show up in the Dock.\nSimilarly, on Windows there are a variety of features in scripting languages, such as PowerShell, Jscript, and Visual Basic to make windows hidden. One example of this is powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden.\nIn addition, Windows supports the CreateDesktop() API that can create a hidden desktop window with its own corresponding explorer.exe process.  All applications running on the hidden desktop window, such as a hidden VNC (hVNC) session, will be invisible to other desktops windows.", "signatures": [{"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "Detected the creation of a hidden window (common execution hiding technique)"}]}, {"id": "T1140", "name": "Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140/", "description": "Adversaries may use Obfuscated Files or Information to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis.

Another example is using the Windows copy /b command to reassemble binary fragments into a malicious payload.\nSometimes a user's action may be required to open it for deobfuscation or decryption as part of User Execution.

Adversaries may abuse these pseudo-hidden keys to conceal payloads/commands used to maintain persistence.  \nThe Registry of a remote system may be modified to aid in execution of files as part of lateral movement.
