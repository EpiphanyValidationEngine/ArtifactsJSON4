Adversaries may use the information from System Information Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.\nTools such as Systeminfo can be used to gather detailed system information. If running with privileged access, a breakdown of system data can be gathered through the systemsetup configuration tool on macOS. As an example, adversaries with user-level access can execute the df -aH command to obtain currently mounted disks and associated freely available space. Adversaries may also leverage a Network Device CLI on network devices to gather detailed system information (e.g. show version). System Information Discovery combined with information gathered from other forms of discovery and reconnaissance can drive payload development and concealment.\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure allow access to instance and virtual machine information via APIs. Successful authenticated API calls can return data such as the operating system platform and status of a particular instance or the model view of a virtual machine.", "signatures": [{"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "query environment variable"}, {"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "get disk information"}, {"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "The binary presents some anomalies in its PE header and/or PE sections."}]}, {"id": "T1083", "name": "File and Directory Discovery", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083/", "description": "Adversaries may enumerate files and directories or may search in specific locations of a host or network share for certain information within a file system.
