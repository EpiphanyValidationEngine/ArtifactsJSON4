Adversaries may use the information from Process Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.\nIn Windows environments, adversaries could obtain details on running processes using the Tasklist utility via cmd or Get-Process via PowerShell. Information about processes can also be extracted from the output of Native API calls such as CreateToolhelp32Snapshot. In Mac and Linux, this is accomplished with the ps command. Adversaries may also opt to enumerate processes via /proc. \nOn network devices, Network Device CLI commands such as show processes can be used to display current running processes.", "signatures": [{"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "The process may have looked for a particular process running on the system"}, {"severity": "UNKNOWN", "description": "The process attempted to detect a running debugger using common APIs"}]}, {"id": "T1012", "name": "Query Registry", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012/", "description": "Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to gather information about the system, configuration, and installed software.\nThe Registry contains a significant amount of information about the operating system, configuration, software, and security.

If running with privileged access, a breakdown of system data can be gathered through the systemsetup configuration tool on macOS. As an example, adversaries with user-level access can execute the df -aH command to obtain currently mounted disks and associated freely available space. Adversaries may also leverage a Network Device CLI on network devices to gather detailed system information (e.g. show version). System Information Discovery combined with information gathered from other forms of discovery and reconnaissance can drive payload development and concealment.\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure allow access to instance and virtual machine information via APIs.
