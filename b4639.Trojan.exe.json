These techniques help adversaries observe the environment and orient themselves before deciding how to act. They also allow adversaries to explore what they can control and what\u2019s around their entry point in order to discover how it could benefit their current objective. Native operating system tools are often used toward this post-compromise information-gathering objective.

This may include changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned from Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.\nAdversaries may use several methods to accomplish Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion such as checking for security monitoring tools (e.g., Sysinternals, Wireshark, etc.) or other system artifacts associated with analysis or virtualization. Adversaries may also check for legitimate user activity to help determine if it is in an analysis environment. Additional methods include use of sleep timers or loops within malware code to avoid operating within a temporary sandbox.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "Contains medium sleeps (>= 30s)"}, {"severity": "INFO", "description": "May sleep (evasive loops) to hinder dynamic analysis"}, {"severity": "INFO", "description": "Allocates memory with a write watch (potentially for evading sandboxes)"}, {"severity": "INFO", "description": "Contains long sleeps (>= 3 min)"}]}, {"id": "T1082", "name": "System Information Discovery", "link": "https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082/", "description": "An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture. Adversaries may use the information from System Information Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.\nTools such as Systeminfo can be used to gather detailed system information. If running with privileged access, a breakdown of system data can be gathered through the systemsetup configuration tool on macOS. As an example, adversaries with user-level access can execute the df -aH command to obtain currently mounted disks and associated freely available space. Adversaries may also leverage a Network Device CLI on network devices to gather detailed system information (e.g. show version). System Information Discovery combined with information gathered from other forms of discovery and reconnaissance can drive payload development and concealment.\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure allow access to instance and virtual machine information via APIs. Successful authenticated API calls can return data such as the operating system platform and status of a particular instance or the model view of a virtual machine.", "signatures": [{"severity": "INFO", "description": "Reads software policies"}, {"severity": "INFO", "description": "Queries the volume information (name, serial number etc) of a device"}]}]}]}}, "links": {"self": "https://www.virustotal.com/api/v3/files/b4639b3526c04be9fa7f6cb1b020f9242ad5fd12bc55965fe783120a2a68e4c0/behaviour_mitre_trees"}}
